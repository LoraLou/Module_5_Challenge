#Write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. 
Observation 1. Capomulin and Ramicane each showed a smaller final tumor volume when compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin (as shown in the box plot). 
Observation 2. The randomly selected mouse l509 was treated with Capolulin. The results showed a decrease in tumor volume over the timepoints (days) tested (as shown in the line graph). 
Observation 3. There was a correlation between the average tumor volume and the weight of the mice in the Capomulin regimen (as shown in the linear regression scatter plot).
